Path@Penn UI Redesign Prototype
Overview

This project is a prototype redesign of the Path@Penn mobile course registration interface. It focuses on improving usability during registration, particularly around planning, cart management, and layout consistency. The prototype is built using HTML and CSS only, so it is static and intended for demonstration purposes.

Features

Penn Branding Bar: Navy header with logo and welcome text aligned to match mobile layout.

Hero Section: Red “Search Classes” bar styled consistently with full width.

Suggestions & Carts Sections: Displayed with borders and background styling for clarity.

Move Plan to Cart Button: Demonstrates the proposed feature that allows students to move all classes from a saved plan into their cart in one click.

Light Blue Background: Provides a clean and modern visual feel.
